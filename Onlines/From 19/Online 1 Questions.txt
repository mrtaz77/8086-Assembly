B1 (Monday 11 am)
A sequence of lowercase letters will be given as input, followed by an uppercase letter working as the input terminator. Output the minimum among the lowercase letters in uppercase.

B2 (Monday 2.30 pm)
Input:
Two strings of size between 1 and 6
Each character is between abcde
Take input one by one until user presses Enter

- Find the hash value of each string
- Simple hash function, positional value*character value
a is 1
b is 2
...
e is 5

Output:
If both of the strings have the same hash value, print PE. Otherwise, print NE. 

A1 (Tuesday 11 am)
Take a ternary number as input and print binary as output
Input may have chars other than 0 1 2, skip them (don't stop the program there)
Input stops when user presses enter and show binary output (in order of LSB to MSB)

A2 (Tuesday 2.30 pm)
Given two 16 bit integers a, b >=1 in decimal representation, output their GCD in decimal (in order of most significant digit to least significant digit).
GCD(a, b):
	while a!=b
		if a>b
			c=a-b
			a=c
		else if b>a
			c=b-a
			b=c
		else
			return a
